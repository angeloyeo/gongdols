Combine translation and rotation (C and D) to make the plane do loops.

%Compound Patch - columns are individual patches

%% Now do loops
%This will probably not match coordinate systems you're using, etc. This
%just shows how you can do rotation and translation together

vel = 0.1*[0 1 0]; %Velocity vector -- in this case, we're saying that the plane always goes in the direction of its nose

    p1.Vertices = (totalRot*OrigVerts')' + repmat(center,[size(OrigVerts,1),1]); %Rotate the patch object about its center and add new center point.
